# Sports Infrastructure and Licensee Correlation Study

Exploring the <strong>Relationship Between Sports Infrastructure and Participation</strong> : This project aims to investigate the correlation between the availability of sports infrastructure and the number of individuals obtaining sports licenses across various sports. By analyzing data on sports facilities and licensee numbers, we seek to <strong>understand how the presence of infrastructure influences sports participation rates</strong>. <strong>This study holds potential implications for urban planning, sports policy development, and investment strategies in sports facilities.</strong>
